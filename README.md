**TikTokDL**
TikTokDL is a TikTok Video Downloader developed with [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29) & [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/). The current features of the application is limited.

I was initially working on a multi SoMe Video-Downloader, but I decided to split it in multiple parts, hence the reason why this repo does not have many commits (I just ported the TikTok part out of that other app I was making).

More features will be added gradually and below you can find a list of stuff I am working on or have already done. Currently the application does not use any webscraping, but it will be added soon to scrape data about TikTok profiles and to download multi-profile videos at once and so on.
